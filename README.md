# 🔒 Security Implementation

## Password Hashing

User account passwords are hashed using:

```javascript
bcryptjs;
```

before storing in MongoDB.

---

## JWT Authentication

Protected API routes use:

```javascript
jsonwebtoken;
```

for authentication and authorization.

---

## Password Encryption

Stored credentials are encrypted before being saved to the database.

Sensitive password data is never stored in plain text.

---

## Environment Variables

Secrets are stored securely using:

```env
MONGODB_URI=
JWT_SECRET=
ENCRYPTION_KEY=
FRONTEND_URL=
```

and are never committed to GitHub.
